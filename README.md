## Hi there 👋 I’m Timo

I’m a passionate software developer with a strong focus on **systems programming, security, and scalable infrastructure**.

I combine **Rust, C++ and TypeScript** with **network & security engineering** to build stable, secure and maintainable systems.  
I use **AI-assisted development** as a tool without compromising code quality, architecture or security.

### Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Rust, C++, TypeScript / JavaScript
- **Systems:** Linux, Networking, Firewalls, VPNs
- **Topics:** Security, Automation, Infrastructure, CLI tools

### What I’m working on
- System & network tools written in Rust and C++
- Security-focused backend & infrastructure projects
- CLI tools and low-level software

### Open to
Available for **freelance / contract projects** — no permanent roles.
I build secure, scalable systems combining software engineering and infrastructure.
